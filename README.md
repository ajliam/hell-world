# hello-world

Hi Everyone!

Andrew here, I am fascinated by web development and the solutions it provides for people, careers, and building amazing things. I'm going to commit myself to this exciting world of web developmemt by learning the basics. Send it!

Currently, I'm a Technical Recruiter that has been fascinated about the work of the people that I recruit. I couldn't be in a better position to start this journey of web development. My hopes of learning programming that one day, I can make the switch from recruiting into software engineering. I know that this journey is long and I'm just going to enjoy the ride!
